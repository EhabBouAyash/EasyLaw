First we have to download the .idx files from https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/daily-index/


Things to add to the url: 


1) year: 2010, 2011, 2012, ...
2) Quarter: QTR1, QTR2


In each .idx file we have text files that I can query as: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/ + the url extension mentioned for each row like "edgar/data/1084869/0001437749-24-000106.txt".

Goal	Method
Get all filings daily	Parse master.YYYYMMDD.idx files
Filter by type	Look for 10-K, 8-K, S-1, EX-10, etc.
Find NDAs & MSAs	Target Exhibit 10 filings
Download + process files	Build batch jobs, respect rate limits
